# Census Management Tool
<p>Census management tool as the name suggests is a tool to help an organization or the government in the census enumeration process.
The tool is a desktop application written in JavaFX to achieve an excellent user interface. This project is open source as the developers
involved are open to suggestions and corrections. The goal of this project is to make a great tool that can be used and implemented
in a census enumeration process</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Using the tool a user can customize census questions, manage users and handle the census enumeration process. The tool shall have
an administrator panel, a supervisor panel, a cenus enumerator panel and a census text editor</p>
<h6>Administrator panel functions</h6>
<ul><li>The administrator can upload census questions in different categories to the census enumerator panel. 
Through the help of the census text editor</li>
<li>The administator can manage supervisors. 
Handling of permissions to the tool such as adding, deleting and approval of pending supervisors</li></ul>
<h6>Supervisor panel functions</h6>
<ul><li>The supervisors manages the locations where the enumeration process will be carried out by assigning a certain census enumerators</li>
<li>The system would generate a map for the regions/locations where the supervisor has requested for an enumerator.</li>
<li>Manage census enumerators. Handling of permissions to the tool such as adding, deleting and approval of pending census enumerators.</li></ul>
<h6>Census enumerator panel functions</h6>
<ul><li>The census enumerators would be carring out the census enumeration process.</li>
<li>The system would generate reports for regions/locations for completed census enumeration tasks.</li></ul>
<h2>Development and testing of the code</h2>
<p>The tool can be developed in any IDE of choice. We recommend IntelliJ as it well supports java and dependancies that would be later
introduced in the project. The JavaFX scene builder is an excellent tool to develop the user interfaces. To develop the project a Java 
development kit is required, JDK and a Java Runtime Environment, JRE to run the application.</p>
